# doublezkp
Double zk-SNARK secured voting system

Key notes!

- make sure that the python environment is updated and includes all the libraries needed

- the smart contract is time-limited and has to be re-deployed

- after deploying the smart contract, the contract adress and the ABI of the contract have to be replaced in the frontend code (replace the old ones)

- for ease of use, everything else is already set up, including the trusted setup keys, circuits and hashes
